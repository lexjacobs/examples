# talon_user:
Commands for early beta of the [Talon hands-free input platform](https://talonvoice.com/). Grammar files originally forked from https://github.com/talonvoice/examples, also incorporating/modifying most of the modules released at tabrat/talon_user(https://github.com/tabrat/talon_user).

## major departures from tabrat repository above contained within this repo:
Despecialized domain specific vocabulary from VoiceCode towards a goal of robust branches of plain English command words. Evolved related syntax into common word "trunks". This repository only tracks the few files that are not contained within the `talon_community` repository (described below). My complete original grammar files, prior to switching to the community repository, are archived on the `pre-community-backup` branch in this repo. 

## current status:
Switched to using [talon_community](https://github.com/dwiel/talon_community) as the basis of my grammar files. My `talon_community` repository updates are at [my talon_community repo](https://github.com/lexjacobs/talon_community/tree/lex) (`master` should be more or less up to date with `upstream`. I'm tracking my daily-use branch on the `lex` branch).
